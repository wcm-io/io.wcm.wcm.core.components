## Enhanced Features

* Inherits all features from its [super component][extends-component]
* Uses [wcm.io Link Handler][wcmio-handler-link] for processing the navigation links
* Detection of navigation root
    * By default, [wcm.io URL Handler][wcmio-handler-url] is used for detecting the Site Root
    * Additionally, an relative path can be configured as "Navigation root" property, which is resolved relative to the automatic detected site root
    * Alternatively, an absolute path can be configured as "Navigation root" - it is rewritten to the current context and used to resolve the root page
